This is the Water Games website code (not up to date) which I will be updating when sufficient changes are made. I plan to have multiple projects hosted here with Water Games as their central home page. I have linked the preview website for this bellow.

This website will have anything i think is worth posting and i am trying to make this primarily dynamic.
An example of this is dynamic style is with my header.js which auto genarates a header each page.

I have added a colour changing mode on the top right of the header which will change the scheme of the header.
